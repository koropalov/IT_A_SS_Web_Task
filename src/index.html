            road bicycle racer, who currently rides for UCI WorldTeam Bora–Hansgrohe.[6] Sagan had a successful
            junior cyclo-cross and mountain bike racing career, winning the Junior Mountain Bike World Championship
            in 2008, before moving to road racing.
            Sagan is considered one of cycling's greatest talents, having earned many prestigious victories,[7][8]
            including three consecutive World Championships, one European Championship, two Paris–Nice stages, seven
            Tirreno–Adriatico stages, one in the Tour de Romandie, three and the overall classification in the Tour de

            first rider to win the points classification of the Tour de France on his first five attempts, he went on
            to win it a record seven times, in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <div class="content">
            Peter was the last child of his parents, who have two more sons and a daughter. Peter was brought up
            older sister, since his parents devoted most of the day to the maintenance of a small grocery
            store. Their middle son, Jurai, Peter's brother, also became a cyclist, and is in the same team.
            Peter started cycling at the age of 9 in his native Zilina. Sagan was noticed for his interesting style:
            tennis shoes and a T-shirt. He also attracted a lot of attention by appearing at the Slovak Championship
            with
            sister's bike. Then Peter mistakenly sold his bike, and the spare sponsored bike
            could not be received in time. He won that race, despite the fact that he was in the usual non-professional
            a bike with poor brakes and grip.

            Successfully performing both on the highway and on rough terrain, in 2008 he became the world champion
            among juniors in cross-country.
            In 2010, Sagan obtained a professional license and signed a two-year contract with
            Liquigas-Cannondale, which was renewed for another year in April. In January, Slovak started on the Tour
            Down
            Ander, where in the second stage he fell very unsuccessfully. But with 17 stitches applied, he finished
            twice in
            top five in the remaining stages. On March 10, Sagan won his first race, Stage 3 Paris - Nice.
            And the victory in the 5th stage allowed him to win the sprint classification. On the Tour of Romandy, Sagan
            won
            one stage, and finished second twice more. In May, he won two sprint finishes on the Tour of California.
            where he again excelled in points. During the season, Sagan finished in the top ten more than once.
            prestigious races, including second place at the Montreal Grand Prix. These achievements made him the main
            opening of the season [2].
            In 2011, the Slovak also won a number of victories at the stages of multi-day races, two of which he managed
            to win:
            Tour of Poland and Giro di Sardinia. In September, Sagan made his grand tour debut, starting at the Vuelta.
            and won 3 stages at once - more than anyone else.
            In early spring 2012, he won several stages of multi-day events and got into the top five at
            Milan - San Remo and Tour of Flanders. At the 2012 Tour de France, Sagan won 3 of the first 7 stages. More
            wins
            on the Tour he did not win, but the stock of the first week and finishes in high positions of the late
            lowland stages
            Sagan had enough to conquer the green jersey.
