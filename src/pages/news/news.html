                    <p>There was no surprise today and this flat stage came down to a fast bunch sprint.
                        The team did again a very good job, in the final kilometers we were in the front
                        parts of the group and after the last left bend, I entered the long straight
                        stretch well positioned. I did my best in the sprint but it wasn’t enough to take
                        the victory.</p>

                <h3>VICTORY ON GIRO D’ITALIA STAGE 10</h3>
                <div class="article-box">
                    <p>I’m very happy with this victory which also has a special meaning to me since it is
                        my first one ever at the Giro d’Italia. My previous victory was last year at the
                        Tour de France, so I had to wait a bit to get this result. The team and the fans had
                        their expectations, so I owed them a victory. I was on the podium a lot of times but
                        there is a big difference between first and second place. We knew that going in the
                        breakaway would be important today but I can guarantee you it wasn’t easy at all.
                        It was very hard, it took a lot of effort and I think the escapees today were the ones
                        with the best legs. On top of that, once our group was formed we had to work hard for a
                        long time because the peloton, with Groupama-FDJ in front, also tried hard to bring us back.
                        It took us a long time to build an advantage. In the final climbs, especially the last one,
                        I knew I had to give it my all because I needed to have a gap and then make sure I didn’t crash
                        in the last descent. I lost a bit of time there and in the final 7km it was important to go on
                        the limit because behind me there was a group of 10-15 riders that certainly wanted to catch me.</p>

                <div class="article-box">
                    <p>It was a very fast stage, very nervous as well, and marked by many crashes.
                        The guys did, once again, an excellent job today, and we were very well positioned for the sprint,
                        which was a chaotic one. I was close to victory but it just wasn’t the day today.</p>

                    <p>The team did a great job today to control the breakaway and set everything for the finale but,
                        unfortunately, after the last curve I found myself in an unfavorable position and I was unable
                        to go for the sprint.</p>
